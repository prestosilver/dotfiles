## Personal highlights

This has been my config since highschool, and has had pretty much every program updated here.
You can see some screenshots of the setup throughout the years in the assets folder.

But here are some apps that I particularly like:
- Mondo themes
- Budwm window manager, I wrote this in highschool and still daily drive it
- Conpositor, a wayland compositor that manages in containers without tiles.
- Zoxide is a thing I could never live without
- O and I use multiple text editors sorry about that.
